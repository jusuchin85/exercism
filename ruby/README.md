# Ruby

The [Ruby track](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby) uses [`minitest`](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/testing/intro-to-tdd.html) for validating your solution:

    gem install minitest

Once installed, you can run the test cases for each exercise:

    ruby <EXERCISE_NAME>_test.rb

where `<EXERCISE_NAME>` is the name of the exercise.
