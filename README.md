# exercism Exercises

This is a repository that stores my learnings from [exercism](https://exercism.org/) - a non-for-profit and independent programming learning site. Includes popular languages such as Python, Ruby, Java and Go.

Ideally, you should be trying out the exercises yourself first before reviewing the answers here. This repository serves as a storage of my exercises so that I can refer to it at a latter time. ðŸ˜„

`exercism` was designed for you to learn by completing exercises and doing self-learnings. Hints are provided along the way should you need to, but it is recommended that you do your own research (links to the language's documentation are provided).

Exercises are validated using the language's own testing toolkit.

To start using `exercism`, you can [install the CLI](https://exercism.org/cli-walkthrough).
